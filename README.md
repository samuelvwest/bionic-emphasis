# bionic-emphasis
Perform a bionic emphasis bolding standard to all text in an element. Inspired by this reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/ut3x75/bionic_reading_does_this_help_you/

##Instructions
1. Add the "bionic-emphasis" class to any element you would like this effect for. 
2. Run the script in the 'bionic-emphasis.js' file 

###If working with a Single-Page Application (SPA)
Pair the script with the [windu.js](https://github.com/samuelvwest/windu) file. This is done in the `bionic-emphasis-with-windu.js` file.
